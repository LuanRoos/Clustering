# Clustering

A project containg two class files, one implementing k-means clustering and another implementing a class to fit Gaussian Mixture Models using and Expectation Maximisation algorithm.

To have a quick and nice illustration of the differences that occur when using k-means vs GMMs to label data, run the examples.py script for a nice set of graphs. The code to see how to fit a k-means or GMM model using my classes should also be pretty clear from just reading how I used them in examples.py
